# AutoSleepData

## [View notebook here](https://nbviewer.org/github/ianian-dot/AutoSleepData/blob/main/AutosleepAnalysis.ipynb)

Data from the app **AutoSleep**

Looking at some technical data from my sleep over the past ~2 years.

Some interesting insights: 
* Do I really have a sleep pattern over the week? ([previous](https://github.com/ianian-dot/personal-sleep-data) smaller sample visualisation seemed to show)
* Correlations between REM, Deep and overall time asleep
* How do each of the sleep types change as I sleep later in the night? 
* (IMO, most interesting) How does my sleep change when I fly to and fro **UK - SG**?
